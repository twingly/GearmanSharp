v0.3.1, 2011-06-27 -- Stopped throwing exceptions from the thread.
 * Stopped throwing exceptions from the worker thread, which could
   crash a service.
v0.3.0, 2011-06-07 -- Status support. Breaking API improvements.
 * Added support for GET_STATUS, STATUS_RES and WORK_STATUS packets.
 * GearmanClient.SubmitBackgroundJob now returns an instance of
   GearmanJobRequest, which you can use to get the status (you need to
   send the GET_STATUS request to the same server as the job is on,
   so we store the connection in the GearmanJobRequest).
 * Removed all specific classes for the different types of packets,
   and added a new class, GearmanProtocol, with static methods for
   packing/unpacking the requests/responses.

v0.2.0, 2011-04-28 -- Breaking API improvements
 * Changed IGearmanJob to have an instance of JobAssigment instead of
   separate properties for JobHandle and FunctionName, to make the raw
   byte[] FunctionArgument available. This is a breaking change.
 
 * Added protected bool OnJobException(Exception, JobAssignment) to
   GearmanWorker to make it possible to handle an exception thrown by a
   job function. If it returns true, then the a wrapping
   GearmanFunctionInternalException will be thrown. If false, the Work
   method will just return false. In GearmanWorker this method returns 
   true. GearmanThreadedWorker overrides this method and returns false,
   to avoid having the work loop stopped. Regardless of what you
   return, the worker will disconnect from the server. If you don't
   want the disconnect to happen, you need to catch the exception in
   the job function.
